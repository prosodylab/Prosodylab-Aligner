A1. SYNPOSIS:

FLAG:       DESCRIPTION:                            DEFAULT:

-i FILE     input file                              STDIN
-o FILE     output file                             STDOUT
-b LIST     batch mode: [LIST is a file containing
            one "INPUT OUTPUT" pair per line]

-r MIN:MAX  pitch range in Hertz                    100:600
-s THRSHLD  strength threshold  [0 <= x <= 1]       0.300
-t SECONDS  timestep in seconds [must be < SF / 2]  0.001

-m          Output Mel pitch                        no
-n          Don't output voiceless frames           no
-h          Display this message, then quit
-v          Display version number, then quit

A2. OUTPUT:

pitch_0 time_0
pitch_1 time_1
... ...
pitch_N time_N

A3. A Python wrapper, swipe.py, is also included. See it for some sample usage.

A3. I also included the original MATLAB code from Camacho as swipe.m
